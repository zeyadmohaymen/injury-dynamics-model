Certainly! For logistic regression, the functions need to be adjusted to reflect the logistic nature of the model. The logistic regression model uses a logistic function to model a binary outcome variable. Here are the modified functions along with their governing equations:

1. **Logistic Regression Model**: 
   - Equation: \( \hat{y} = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-X\theta}} \)
   - Python Function:
   ```python
   def logistic_regression(X, theta):
       return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-np.dot(X, theta)))
   ```

2. **Compute Gradient**:
   - Equation: \( \nabla_\theta J(\theta) = \frac{1}{m} X^T(\hat{y} - y) \)
   - Python Function:
   ```python
   def compute_gradient_logistic(X, y, theta):
       predictions = logistic_regression(X, theta)
       error = predictions - y
       gradient = np.dot(X.T, error) / len(y)
       return gradient
   ```

3. **Compute Loss (Logistic Loss)**:
   - Equation: \( J(\theta) = -\frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^{m} [y^{(i)} \log(\hat{y}^{(i)}) + (1 - y^{(i)}) \log(1 - \hat{y}^{(i)})] \)
   - Python Function:
   ```python
   def logistic_loss(X, y, theta):
       predictions = logistic_regression(X, theta)
       return -np.mean(y * np.log(predictions) + (1 - y) * np.log(1 - predictions))
   ```

4. **Gradient Descent using Euler Method**:
   - The equations and the method remain the same as for linear regression, but with the logistic loss and gradient.
   - Python Function:
   ```python
   def gradient_descent_euler_logistic(X, y, theta, learning_rate, iterations):
       history = []  # to store the history of the cost function
       for _ in range(iterations):
           grad = compute_gradient_logistic(X, y, theta)
           theta = theta - learning_rate * grad
           history.append(logistic_loss(X, y, theta))
       return theta, history
   ```

5. **Gradient Descent using Runge-Kutta 2nd Order Method**:
   - Similar to the linear regression version, but using the logistic regression model and loss.
   - Python Function:
   ```python
   def gradient_descent_runge_kutta_2_logistic(X, y, theta, learning_rate, iterations):
       history = []  # to store the history of the cost function
       for _ in range(iterations):
           k1 = compute_gradient_logistic(X, y, theta)
           k2 = compute_gradient_logistic(X, y, theta - learning_rate * k1)
           theta = theta - (learning_rate / 2) * (k1 + k2)
           history.append(logistic_loss(X, y, theta))
       return theta, history
   ```

**Initial Parameters (Theta):**
- For logistic regression, a common starting point for `theta` is a vector of zeros. However,

the specific choice can depend on your data. If you have prior knowledge about the relationship between your features and the outcome, you can use this to initialize `theta` more effectively. Otherwise, starting with zeros or small random values is a standard approach.

Here's how you might initialize `theta` for a dataset with `n_features`:

```python
n_features = X.shape[1]  # Number of features in your dataset
theta_initial = np.zeros(n_features)
```

Or, for a small random initialization:

```python
theta_initial = np.random.rand(n_features) * 0.01
```

This initialization step is crucial as it can affect the convergence of the gradient descent algorithm. It's a good practice to experiment with different initializations to observe their impact on the model's performance.

Remember, logistic regression is used for binary classification problems. Ensure your target variable `y` is encoded as 0 and 1. The features in `X` should also be properly preprocessed (e.g., normalization) for the algorithm to perform optimally.
